# I Want You

I want you to create a **single-page portfolio website** for a solo electronics student business called **“MBK Electronics”**.  

The purpose of the site is to:  
- Present me as a **student electronics developer**.  
- Show a **simple, growing portfolio** of projects.  
- Make it easy for people to **contact me** for small electronics/prototyping work.  
- Be very easy for me to **update and extend** later.

### Technical + Layout Requirements

- **Single-page layout**, scrollable, with a simple top navigation that jumps to sections:
  - Home
  - About
  - Services
  - Projects
  - Process
  - Contact
- Clean, responsive design that works on **mobile and desktop**.
- Use **plain HTML/CSS/JS** (no heavy frameworks) so I can edit files myself later.
- Keep the CSS organised and easy to modify (clear comments, logical section classes).
- Use placeholder images and text where needed.

### Overall Style

- Minimal, professional, and slightly “techy”.
- Colour palette suggestion:
  - Dark background or accents (e.g. dark navy / charcoal)  
  - Highlight colour (e.g. electric blue or teal)  
  - Plenty of white/neutral space for readability.
- Clean, readable sans-serif font (e.g. Inter, Roboto, or similar).
- Avoid anything flashy or “corporate enterprise” – this is a **personal, student-run** service.

### Section Details

#### 1. Hero / Home Section (top of page)

Content & layout:

- Left side:
  - Big heading: **“MBK Electronics”**
  - Subheading: **“Student-run electronics projects, prototypes and small repairs.”**
  - Short 2–3 line paragraph explaining:
    - I’m an Electrical & Electronic Engineering student in the UK.
    - I build small, practical electronics projects and prototypes while I learn.
- Clear **call-to-action buttons**:
  - “View Projects” (scrolls to Projects section)
  - “Contact Me” (scrolls to Contact section)

- Right side:
  - Placeholder for an image or illustration (e.g. circuit board, oscilloscope, or simple electronics-related graphic).

#### 2. About Section

Content:

- Heading: **“About MBK Electronics”**
- Short paragraph describing:
  - I’m a first-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering student.
  - I use MBK Electronics as a personal brand for my projects and learning.
  - My current focus areas: basic circuits, microcontrollers (e.g. Arduino/ESP32), KiCad PCB design, and simple repairs.
- Bullet points showing my goals:
  - “Build real-world electronics skills while I study.”
  - “Help students and hobbyists bring small electronics ideas to life.”
  - “Develop a portfolio of working projects and prototypes.”

Keep this section simple and text-based.

#### 3. Services Section

Content:

- Heading: **“What I Can Help With”**
- Three simple service blocks/cards:

  1. **Project & Prototype Support**  
     Short description:  
     “Help with simple circuits, breadboard prototypes, and basic microcontroller projects for students and hobbyists.”

  2. **Basic Repairs & Diagnostics**  
     Short description:  
     “Initial checks and small fixes for simple electronic devices (e.g. power issues, connectors, basic soldering).”

  3. **Learning & Documentation**  
     Short description:  
     “Clear explanations, diagrams, and beginner-friendly notes as I learn – ideal for students who want to understand the basics.”

- Underneath, add a **note/disclaimer** style line in smaller text:  
  “MBK Electronics is run by a student engineer. I focus on small-scale, educational and prototype work only.”

#### 4. Projects / Portfolio Section

Content:

- Heading: **“Projects”**
- A grid or vertical list that is easy to extend later.  
- Each project card should have:
  - Project title  
  - 1 small image placeholder  
  - 2–3 line description:
    - What it does  
    - What problem it solves or what I practised  
    - Main tools (e.g. Arduino + KiCad)

- Include 3–4 **dummy projects** that I can later replace with real ones, for example:
  - “LED Pattern Controller (Arduino)”
  - “Temperature Sensor Logger”
  - “Simple Power Supply Board (KiCad)”
- Make sure the HTML structure makes it **easy to duplicate a project card** to add new ones.

#### 5. Process Section

Content:

- Heading: **“How I Work”**
- Simple 3-step layout (icons or numbered blocks):

  1. **Discuss the Idea** – “You tell me what you’re trying to build or fix.”
  2. **Plan a Simple Approach** – “We agree on a small, realistic next step.”
  3. **Build, Test, and Share** – “I prototype, document, and share what I’ve done.”

- Short closing sentence:  
  “Because I’m still learning, I prioritise small, clear projects where I can deliver value and gain experience.”

#### 6. Contact Section

Content:

- Heading: **“Contact”**
- A simple **contact form**:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message
- Placeholder text in the message box suggesting what to include (e.g. “Describe your project or question…”).
- Also display:
  - A simple email address placeholder like `hello@mbkelectronics.co.uk` 
  - Clear note:
  - “I’m a full-time student, so availability is limited – but I’ll reply as soon as I can.”

### Footer

- Simple footer with:
  - “© 2025 MBK Electronics – Student Electronics Projects”
  - Link back to top of page.

### Important: Make It Easy to Edit

Please ensure:

- HTML is clearly sectioned with comments like `<!-- Services Section -->`.
- CSS classes are intuitive (e.g. `.hero`, `.services`, `.project-card`, `.contact-form`).
- No complex build steps – just files I can upload directly to regular cPanel hosting.
- Avoid heavy animations or unnecessary scripts; only minimal JS if needed for form or smooth scrolling.
